## ðŸŒŸ My Programming Journey
My journey as a programmer began during my time at the Complex of Technical Schools, where I majored in IT with a focus on internet applications. 
My passion for programming grew as I pursued higher education studying Automation and Robotics, specializing in industrial automation.

During the last semester of my studies, I began gaining valuable experience by working as a programmer, and after three years, I advanced to the role of team leader. My responsibilities included programming CNC machines, creating user interface applications, writing Python scripts, and implementing real-time Linux modules, among other tasks.

My desire for innovation and progress led me to co-found iMagok sp. z o.o., a company that integrates Automation and Robotics into the IT world. I have worked on various projects, developing skills in TypeScript, NextJS, React, Node.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Express.

Currently, I am working as a Full Stack Developer at tubics, where I am responsible for developing new features and maintaining the platform's frontend, backend, and services. My work involves using technologies such as TypeScript, React, NextJS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Google Cloud Run. I am accountable for full-stack development, troubleshooting performance and maintenance issues, performing code reviews, and actively participating in agile work processes.
